## The Lab

### Part Zero: Sign up for a Socrata API Token

1. Follow the instructions in the "Getting an App Token" section of the "NYC Open Data" lesson.

### Part One: 🐿

1. Use the [NYC Open Data Portal](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/) to locate the "2018 Central Park Squirrel Census - Squirrel Data" dataset.
2. Consult the API Documentation, and open the API endpoint (the URL ending in `.json`) in a new tab.
3. Append your App Token to the end of the URL.
4. Filter the data to only those squirrels who were viewed while running: `running=true`.
